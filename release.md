As a whole I agree with the rules set by the author, and what feels validating is reading atleast some of them and know that you have been actively thinking about them all along, particularly intention-revealing names. My go-to way of thinking when it comes to naming is that the name should tell you enough, to the point where comments are not needed. However thinking of naming in terms of verbs for methods and nouns for variables is something I haven't actively been thinking of, but will for sure do in the future. 

Avoiding mental mapping is another one I really took to heart since I know this is something I have done personally, and on the flipside I have a really hard time reading code written by others, or by myself in the past. Using i,j or k in loops and if-statements is something probably every programmer is guilty, and I know I'm not helping myself or others with this and I will definitely take this with me, and be more explicit with my code. 

Out of everything in the chapter that struck me the hardest it would have to be "Clarity is king". It has been what I have been striving for since i started programming merely a year ago, but there are clearly things I haven't thought of in the slightest, and things I have thought about, but can improve a considerable amount.
